// --- Day 12: Rain Risk ---
// Your ferry made decent progress toward the island, but the storm came in faster than anyone
// expected. The ferry needs to take evasive actions!
//
// Unfortunately, the ship's navigation computer seems to be malfunctioning; rather than giving a
// route directly to safety, it produced extremely circuitous instructions. When the captain uses
// the PA system to ask if anyone can help, you quickly volunteer.
//
// The navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of a sequence of single-character
// actions paired with integer input values. After staring at them for a few minutes, you work out
// what they probably mean:
//
// Action N means to move north by the given value.
// Action S means to move south by the given value.
// Action E means to move east by the given value.
// Action W means to move west by the given value.
// Action L means to turn left the given number of degrees.
// Action R means to turn right the given number of degrees.
// Action F means to move forward by the given value in the direction the ship is currently facing.
// The ship starts by facing east. Only the L and R actions change the direction the ship is facing.
// (That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is N10, the ship would move north
// 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were F.)
//
// For example:
//
// F10
// N3
// F7
// R90
// F11
// These instructions would be handled as follows:
//
// F10 would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to east 10, north 0.
// N3 would move the ship 3 units north to east 10, north 3.
// F7 would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to east 17, north 3.
// R90 would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face south; it remains at east 17, north 3.
// F11 would move the ship 11 units south to east 17, south 8.
// At the end of these instructions, the ship's Manhattan distance (sum of the absolute values of
// its east/west position and its north/south position) from its starting position is 17 + 8 = 25.
//
// Figure out where the navigation instructions lead. What is the Manhattan distance between that
// location and the ship's starting position?

// --- Part Two ---
// Before you can give the destination to the captain, you realize that the actual action meanings
// were printed on the back of the instructions the whole time.
//
// Almost all of the actions indicate how to move a waypoint which is relative to the ship's
// position:
//
// Action N means to move the waypoint north by the given value.
// Action S means to move the waypoint south by the given value.
// Action E means to move the waypoint east by the given value.
// Action W means to move the waypoint west by the given value.
// Action L means to rotate the waypoint around the ship left (counter-clockwise) the given number
// of degrees.
// Action R means to rotate the waypoint around the ship right (clockwise) the given number of degrees.
// Action F means to move forward to the waypoint a number of times equal to the given value.
// The waypoint starts 10 units east and 1 unit north relative to the ship. The waypoint is relative
// to the ship; that is, if the ship moves, the waypoint moves with it.
//
// For example, using the same instructions as above:
//
// F10 moves the ship to the waypoint 10 times (a total of 100 units east and 10 units north),
// leaving the ship at east 100, north 10. The waypoint stays 10 units east and 1 unit north of the
// ship.
// N3 moves the waypoint 3 units north to 10 units east and 4 units north of the ship. The ship
// remains at east 100, north 10.
// F7 moves the ship to the waypoint 7 times (a total of 70 units east and 28 units north), leaving
// the ship at east 170, north 38. The waypoint stays 10 units east and 4 units north of the ship.
// R90 rotates the waypoint around the ship clockwise 90 degrees, moving it to 4 units east and 10
// units south of the ship. The ship remains at east 170, north 38.
// F11 moves the ship to the waypoint 11 times (a total of 44 units east and 110 units south),
// leaving the ship at east 214, south 72. The waypoint stays 4 units east and 10 units south of the
// ship.
// After these operations, the ship's Manhattan distance from its starting position is
// 214 + 72 = 286.
//
// Figure out where the navigation instructions actually lead. What is the Manhattan distance
// between that location and the ship's starting position?
